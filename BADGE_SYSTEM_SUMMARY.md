# Badge System & Shop Expansion Summary

## Overview
Implemented an achievement-based badge system and expanded the shop inventory based on user requirements. Badges are no longer purchasable items but are unlocked by completing specific achievements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes

#### New Tables Created

**`badges` Table**
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- name (TEXT) - Badge name
- description (TEXT) - What the badge represents
- icon (TEXT) - Emoji icon for the badge
- unlock_condition (JSONB) - Flexible unlock criteria
- order_index (INTEGER) - Display order
- created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
```

**`student_badges` Table**
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- student_id (UUID, Foreign Key -> students.id)
- badge_id (UUID, Foreign Key -> badges.id)
- unlocked_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- UNIQUE(student_id, badge_id) - Prevent duplicate unlocks
```

#### Students Table Updates

Added streak tracking columns:
```sql
- current_streak (INTEGER) - Current consecutive days of learning
- longest_streak (INTEGER) - Best streak ever achieved
- last_lesson_date (DATE) - For streak calculation
```

### 4. Badge Unlock System

#### Automatic Badge Detection
Created `/src/lib/badges/checkBadgeUnlocks.ts` utility function that:
- Checks all badge unlock conditions for a student
- Compares student progress against requirements
- Automatically unlocks badges when conditions are met
- Returns list of newly unlocked badges

#### Integration Points

**Lesson Completion** (`src/app/lessons/[id]/page.tsx`)
- After completing a lesson, `checkAndUnlockBadges()` is called
- Newly unlocked badges are displayed in a celebration modal
- Modal shows badge icon, name, and animated congratulations

**Streak Tracking**
- Streak is calculated when completing lessons
- Compares `last_lesson_date` with current date
- Increments streak for consecutive days
- Resets to 1 if gap > 1 day
- Tracks both `current_streak` and `longest_streak`

### 5. UI Components

#### BadgesPanel Component (`src/components/profile/BadgesPanel.tsx`)

Features:
- Displays all 18 badges in responsive grid
- Shows unlock status (unlocked/locked)
- For unlocked badges: Shows icon and description
- For locked badges: Shows lock icon and unlock requirement
- Progress bar showing X/18 badges unlocked
- Motivational messages based on progress

Visual Design:
- Unlocked badges: Gold gradient background, award checkmark
- Locked badges: Grayscale, muted colors, lock icon
- Grid layout: 2-5 columns depending on screen size
- Hover effects on unlocked badges

#### Badge Unlock Modal (Lesson Page)

When badges are unlocked:
- Full-screen overlay with celebration
- Animated bouncing 🎉 emoji
- Gold gradient title "Badge Unlocked!"
- Shows all newly unlocked badges
- Gold "Awesome!" button to dismiss

### 6. Profile Page Integration

Updated `/src/app/profile/page.tsx`:
- Removed 5 hardcoded badge cards
- Integrated `<BadgesPanel userId={user.id} />`
- Panel automatically fetches and displays all badges
- Shows real-time unlock status from database

### 7. Files Created/Modified

#### New Files
- `/src/lib/badges/checkBadgeUnlocks.ts` - Badge unlock logic
- `/src/components/profile/BadgesPanel.tsx` - Badge display component
- `/supabase/migrations/badges_system_and_expand_shop.sql` - Main migration
- `/supabase/migrations/add_streak_to_students.sql` - Streak tracking migration

- `/src/app/profile/page.tsx` - Integrated BadgesPanel
- `/src/app/shop/page.tsx` - Removed badges category
- `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - (Already had profile fetching)

### 8. Database Migrations

**Migration 1: `badges_system_and_expand_shop`**
- Created `badges` table with 18 achievement badges
- Created `student_badges` table for tracking unlocks
- Deleted 5 badge items from `shop_items`
- Added 15 new shop items (5 avatars, 5 power-ups, 5 themes)
- Set up RLS policies for both new tables
- Created indexes for performance

**Migration 2: `add_streak_to_students`**
- Added `current_streak` column to `students`
- Added `longest_streak` column to `students`
- Added `last_lesson_date` column to `students`
- All columns default to 0 or NULL

### 9. Security & Permissions

#### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

**`badges` table (Public Read)**
- All users can view all badges
- Only service role can insert/update/delete

**`student_badges` table**
- Students can only view their own unlocked badges
- Service role can unlock badges for students
- Prevents duplicate unlocks via unique constraint

### 10. Testing Verification

✅ Database verification completed:
- 18 badges exist in `badges` table
- 30 shop items exist: 10 avatars, 10 power-ups, 10 themes
- 0 badges remain in shop (successfully removed)
- RLS policies active on all tables
- Indexes created for performance

✅ Development server running:
- No TypeScript errors
- No ESLint errors
- All pages compile successfully
- Badge system integrated into lesson flow

### 11. User Experience Flow

#### Unlocking a Badge

1. Student completes a lesson
2. System updates student progress, coins, XP, and streak
3. `checkAndUnlockBadges()` runs automatically
4. Function checks all 18 badge conditions
5. If any conditions are newly met, badge is unlocked
6. Badge is inserted into `student_badges` table
7. Celebration modal appears showing new badge(s)
8. Student clicks "Awesome!" to continue
9. Badge appears unlocked in profile page

#### Viewing Badges

1. Student navigates to Profile page
2. BadgesPanel loads all badges from database
3. Queries student's unlocked badges
4. Displays grid with unlock status
5. Locked badges show how to unlock them
6. Progress bar shows percentage completed
7. Motivational messages encourage continued learning

### 12. Achievement Types Implemented

- **Quantity-based**: Complete X lessons, earn X coins/XP
- **Completion-based**: Finish all lessons in a world
- **Streak-based**: Learn X consecutive days
- **Quality-based**: Perfect scores, no hints used
- **Speed-based**: Complete lessons quickly
- **Time-based**: Early bird, night owl achievements
- **Exploration-based**: Try all worlds, purchase items
- **Consistency-based**: Weekend learning

### 13. Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential additions for future sprints:
- Badge rarity levels (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary)
- Badge collections/categories on profile
- Social sharing of badge achievements
- Seasonal/limited-time event badges
- Team/classroom badge leaderboards
- Badge progress tracking (e.g., "3/10 lessons completed")
- Badge notifications in navigation bar
- Badge sound effects and animations

### 14. Performance Considerations

- Badge checking runs only after lesson completion (not on every page load)
- Uses database indexes on foreign keys for fast queries
- JSONB unlock conditions allow flexible schema without migrations
- RLS policies ensure secure data access
- BadgesPanel uses single query to fetch all badges
- Student badges fetched separately for efficiency
